<p><em>You do not have to be a good writer to write a good scientific paper, follow the structure and focus more on the science.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only purpose of a paper: <em><strong>effective communication of scientific ideas</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Most papers use an “IMRaD” format: <code>Introduction</code>, <code>Method</code>, <code>Results and Discussion</code>, <code>Conclusions</code>. Two main advantages: it makes it easier for the writer to organize the content of the paper, and it makes it easier for the reader to opportunistically find the information they seek.</p>
<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>scope, novelty, and significance.</p>
<p>The basic flow of the introduction starts with the general and then moves to the specific:</p>
<ol>
<li>Establish a territory (what is the field of the work, why is this field important, what has already been done?),</li>
<li>Establish a niche (indicate a gap, raise a question, or challenge prior work in this territory), and</li>
<li>Occupy that niche (outline the purpose and announce the present research; optionally summarize the results).</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Method"><a href="#Method" class="headerlink" title="Method"></a>Method</h1><h2 id="Scientific-writing-101"><a href="#Scientific-writing-101" class="headerlink" title="Scientific writing 101"></a>Scientific writing 101</h2><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Less is more when it comes to writing a good scientific paper. Tell a story in clear, simple language and keep in mind the importance of the ‘big picture’.</strong></em></p>
<p>Ah, the pleasures of reading. Whether it’s a piece of fiction, a poem or a scientific paper, you know when you’ve read a really good one. We have all also struggled through really poorly written pieces with no end in sight. Though most of us have the luxury of abandoning pieces of writing that are not up to snuff, editors and reviewers don’t and must slog through papers that seem to go on forever and, more dishearteningly, have the main points and interesting bits inexplicably hidden.</p>
<p>So, in an effort to kill two birds with one stone, we would like to give our authors a few simple pointers on how to write better papers and in so doing (perhaps) make everyone’s lives just a little bit easier. Before we begin, our apologies to those for whom this is obvious—our aim is not to be insulting or condescending. Instead, think of these as tips and gentle reminders of what you learned long ago but may have forgotten along the way.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tell a story</strong></em>. We all love listening to a good story. And we all tell stories, but some are better at it than others, and those who tell the best stories are most able to get their points across. How you got your data is not that important—we don’t need a chronology (first we did this, then we did that, etc.). Instead, now that you have the data and have interpreted them a certain way, think about how best to tell a story in light of all the previous work in the field, the question(s) you are addressing and why that question is important. How do your results advance our understanding of the question(s)? Have you discovered something new or unexpected? Consider how your findings fit into the broader context of the field, whether they are likely to change the way people in the field will think about the topic and how they will drive further experiments in the future.</p>
<p><em><strong>Be clear</strong></em>. Making your story clear is not the same thing as dumbing it down. No reviewer has ever said that a paper was too easy to read. We do, however, get complaints from reviewers about how complicated, convoluted or downright confusing a paper is. Clear, simple language allows the data and their interpretation to come through. Remember that clarity is especially important when you are trying to get complicated ideas across. Keep the jargon to a minimum and explain the terms you do use. When you’re done, give your paper to a scientist outside your field and ask that person to read it for clarity. He or she will be able to point out all the remaining jargon, whether the experimental design, results and data interpretation are clear and how interesting your paper is to someone working in another area.</p>
<p><em><strong>Provide an informative title and abstract</strong></em>. PubMed allows one to search through ∼19 million citations, and Table of Contents e-alerts bring you the latest from your favorite journals. And what do you see when your e-alert arrives or your search is complete?—the title and abstract. Most people will stop there without reading any further, so don’t blow it with a boring title. Make the abstract clear and try to get the ‘big picture’ across. Do not get bogged down in details. As an author, this is also your chance to draw your readers in, to entice them to read on. If the title and abstract are comprehensible to only a handful of people directly in your field, you have greatly narrowed the potential readership of your paper.</p>
<p>Titles like “Studies of X and Y…” or “Characterization of A and B” make my eyes glaze over. They tell you nothing and don’t offer much hope for the rest of the paper. The title should highlight the main point of the paper. The abstract should frame the question(s) to be addressed and why they are important, how you have solved the problems and how the results can be placed in the wider context of the field. The experimental details should be left for the body of the paper (unless you are describing a new technique). End your abstract with the broader implications of the work.</p>
<p><em><strong>Make the introduction short and concise</strong></em>. Remember, you are not writing an Annual Review of XYZ. You need to tell the reader only what he or she needs to know to understand this piece of work (we know that you know much more than you are telling us here). Provide just enough background so that the reader can understand how the question(s) you are asking fills a gap in the knowledge of the field. You should cite all the relevant references—remember, we use PubMed too—and finish the introduction with a short paragraph stating what the paper shows.</p>
<p><em><strong>Clearly distinguish Results from Discussion</strong></em>. The Results should describe the results, and the Discussion should put those results in a broader context. Thus, the Discussion should not be a repeat of the Results. Instead, it should be an interpretation of those results and how they fit (or don’t fit) with previous work as well as a description of how your work provides a conceptual advance beyond those studies. The Discussion should end with unanswered questions. A model (in the form of a schematic diagram) is often useful to tie together your work with previous data (I often find myself trying to draw one; I’m sure the authors could do a better job).</p>
<p>I’d like to discuss the importance of the cover letter, but I am out of space, so I have to end with a few personal gripes. Run a spell check before submitting your paper. Numerous spelling mistakes give us (and the reviewers) the impression that the paper was either hastily or sloppily prepared, or both—not a good start. Also, number your pages and figures (but please don’t number the lines; it’s very distracting). Once the paper is printed out and we begin to read it, a lack of page numbers makes our task and that of the reviewers more difficult than it needs to be. Use fonts and line spacing that are easy on the eyes. These are simple things that take only a few extra minutes when preparing your manuscript, but they can make a big difference to the experience of reading it. Remember: the idea is to make the editor’s (and reviewers’) life easier, not harder.</p>

<p><em>Six experts offer advice on producing a manuscript that will get published and pull in readers.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Manuscripts may have a rigidly defined structure, but there’s still room to tell a compelling story — one that clearly communicates the science and is a pleasure to read. Scientist-authors and editors debate the importance and meaning of creativity and offer tips on how to write a top paper.</p>
<h3 id="Keep-your-message-clear"><a href="#Keep-your-message-clear" class="headerlink" title="Keep your message clear"></a>Keep your message clear</h3><p><em>Angel Borja, marine scientist at AZTI-Tecnalia, a producer of sustainable business services and goods, Pasaia, Spain; journal editor; author of a</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://go.nature.com/2gu4hp9"><em>series on preparing a manuscript</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Think about the message you want to give to readers. If that is not clear, misinterpretations may arise later. And a clear message is even more important when there is a multidisciplinary group of authors, which is increasingly common. I encourage groups to sit together in person and seek consensus — not only in the main message, but also in the selection of data, the visual presentation and the information necessary to transmit a strong message.</p>
<p>The most important information should be in the main text. To avoid distraction, writers should put additional data in the supplementary material.</p>
<p>Countless manuscripts are rejected because the discussion section is so weak that it’s obvious the writer does not clearly understand the existing literature. Writers should put their results into a global context to demonstrate what makes those results significant or original.</p>
<p>There is a narrow line between speculation and evidence-based conclusions. A writer can speculate in the discussion — but not too much. When the discussion is all speculation, it’s no good because it is not rooted in the author’s experience. In the conclusion, include a one- or two-sentence statement on the research you plan to do in the future and on what else needs to be explored.</p>
<h3 id="Create-a-logical-framework"><a href="#Create-a-logical-framework" class="headerlink" title="Create a logical framework"></a>Create a logical framework</h3><p><em>Brett Mensh, scientific adviser, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Janelia Research Campus, Ashburn, Virginia; consultant, science communications.</em></p>
<p>Structure is paramount. If you don’t get the structure right, you have no hope.</p>
<p>I co-wrote a paper (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://doi.org/ckqp">B. Mensh and K. Kording <em>PLoS Comput. Biol.</em> http://doi.org/ckqp; 2017</a>) that lays out structural details for using a context–content–conclusion scheme to build a core concept. It is one of the most highly tweeted papers so far. In each paragraph, the first sentence defines the context, the body contains the new idea and the final sentence offers a conclusion. For the whole paper, the introduction sets the context, the results present the content and the discussion brings home the conclusion.</p>
<p>It’s crucial to focus your paper on a single key message, which you communicate in the title. Everything in the paper should logically and structurally support that idea. It can be a delight to creatively bend the rules, but you need to know them first.</p>
<p>You have to guide the naive reader to the point at which they are ready to absorb what you did. As a writer, you need to detail the problem. I won’t know why I should care about your experiment until you tell me why I should.</p>
<h3 id="State-your-case-with-confidence"><a href="#State-your-case-with-confidence" class="headerlink" title="State your case with confidence"></a>State your case with confidence</h3><p><em>Dallas Murphy, book author, New York City; instructor, writing workshops for scientists in Germany, Norway and the United States.</em></p>
<p>Clarity is the sole obligation of the science writer, yet I find constantly that the ‘What’s new’ element is buried. Answering one central question — What did you do? — is the key to finding the structure of a piece. Every section of the manuscript needs to support that one fundamental idea.</p>
<p>There is a <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdG9yeWRyaXZlbi5uZXQvYmxvZy5odG0/cG9zdD04ODUxOTI=">German concept known as the ‘red thread’<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>, which is the straight line that the audience follows from the introduction to the conclusion. In science, ‘What’s new and compelling?’ is the red thread. It’s the whole reason for writing the paper. Then, once that’s established, the paragraphs that follow become the units of logic that comprise the red thread.</p>
<p>Scientific authors are often scared to make confident statements with muscularity. The result is turgid or obfuscatory writing that sounds defensive, with too many caveats and long lists — as if the authors are writing to fend off criticism that hasn’t been made yet. When they write for a journal gatekeeper rather than for a human being, the result is muddy prose.</p>
<p>Examples such as this are not uncommon: “Though not inclusive, this paper provides a useful review of the well-known methods of physical oceanography using as examples various research that illustrates the methodological challenges that give rise to successful solutions to the difficulties inherent in oceanographic research.” Why not this instead: “We review methods of oceanographic research with examples that reveal specific challenges and solutions”?</p>
<p>And if the prose muddies the science, the writer has not only failed to convey their idea, but they’ve also made the reader work so hard that they have alienated him or her. The reader’s job is to pay attention and remember what they read. The writer’s job is to make those two things easy to do. I encourage scientists to read outside their field to better appreciate the craft and principles of writing.</p>
<h3 id="Beware-the-curse-of-‘zombie-nouns’"><a href="#Beware-the-curse-of-‘zombie-nouns’" class="headerlink" title="Beware the curse of ‘zombie nouns’"></a>Beware the curse of ‘zombie nouns’</h3><p><em>Zoe Doubleday, ecologist, University of Adelaide, Australia; co-author of a</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(17)30159-3"><em>paper on embracing creativity</em></a> <em>and writing accessible prose in scientific publications.</em></p>
<p>Always think of your busy, tired reader when you write your paper — and try to deliver a paper that you would enjoy reading yourself.</p>
<p>Why does scientific writing have to be stodgy, dry and abstract? Humans are story-telling animals. If we don’t engage that aspect of ourselves, it’s hard to absorb the meaning of what we’re reading. Scientific writing should be factual, concise and evidence-based, but that doesn’t mean it can’t also be creative — told in a voice that is original — and engaging (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2017.06.011">Z. A. Doubleday <em>et al. Trends Ecol. Evol.</em> <strong>32,</strong> 803–805; 2017</a>). If science isn’t read, it doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>One of the principal problems with writing a manuscript is that your individual voice is stamped out. Writers can be stigmatized by mentors, manuscript reviewers or journal editors if they use their own voice. Students tell me they are inspired to write, but worry that their adviser won’t be supportive of creativity. It is a concern. We need to take a fresh look at the ‘official style’ — the dry, technical language that hasn’t evolved in decades.</p>
<p>Author Helen Sword coined the phrase ‘zombie nouns’ to describe terms such as ‘implementation’ or ‘application’ that suck the lifeblood out of active verbs. We should engage readers’ emotions and avoid formal, impersonal language. Still, there’s a balance. Don’t sensationalize the science. Once the paper has a clear message, I suggest that writers try some vivid language to help to tell the story. For example, I got some pushback on the title of one of my recent papers: ‘<span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cDovL2pvdXJuYWxzLnBsb3Mub3JnL3Bsb3NvbmUvYXJ0aWNsZS9jb21tZW50cz9pZD0xMC4xMzcxL2pvdXJuYWwucG9uZS4wMTc3Mzkz">Eight habitats, 38 threats, and 55 experts: Assessing ecological risk in a multi-use marine region<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>’. But, ultimately, the editors let me keep it. There’s probably less resistance out there than people might think.</p>
<p>Recently, after hearing me speak on this topic, a colleague mentioned that she had just rejected a review paper because she felt the style was too non-scientific. She admitted that she felt she had made the wrong decision and would try to reverse it.</p>
<h3 id="Prune-that-purple-prose"><a href="#Prune-that-purple-prose" class="headerlink" title="Prune that purple prose"></a>Prune that purple prose</h3><p><em>Peter Gorsuch, managing editor, Nature Research Editing Service, London; former plant biologist.</em></p>
<p>Writers must be careful about ‘creativity’. It sounds good, but the purpose of a scientific paper is to convey information. That’s it. Flourishes can be distracting. Figurative language can also bamboozle a non-native English speaker. My advice is to make the writing only as complex as it needs to be.</p>
<p>That said, there are any number of ways of writing a paper that are far from effective. One of the most important is omitting crucial information from the methods section. It’s easy to do, especially in a complicated study, but missing information can make it difficult, if not impossible, to reproduce the study. That can mean the research is a dead end.</p>
<p>It’s also important that the paper’s claims are consistent with collected evidence. At the same time, authors should avoid being over-confident in their conclusions.</p>
<p>Editors and peer reviewers are looking for interesting results that are useful to the field. Without those, a paper might be rejected. Unfortunately, authors tend to struggle with the discussion section. They need to explain why the findings are interesting and how they affect a wider understanding of the topic. Authors should also reassess the existing literature and consider whether their findings open the door for future work. And, in making clear how robust their findings are, they must convince readers that they’ve considered alternative explanations.</p>
<h3 id="Aim-for-a-wide-audience"><a href="#Aim-for-a-wide-audience" class="headerlink" title="Aim for a wide audience"></a>Aim for a wide audience</h3><p><em>Stacy Konkiel, director of research and education at Altmetric, London, which scores research papers on the basis of their level of digital attention.</em></p>
<p>There have been no in-depth studies linking the quality of writing to a paper’s impact, but a recent one (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2016.11.018">N. Di Girolamo and R. M. Reynders <em>J. Clin. Epidemiol.</em> <strong>85,</strong> 32–36; 2017</a>) shows that articles with clear, succinct, declarative titles are more likely to get picked up by social media or the popular press.</p>
<p>Those findings tie in with my experience. My biggest piece of advice is to get to the point. Authors spend a lot of time setting up long-winded arguments to knock down possible objections before they actually state their case. Make your point clearly and concisely — if possible in non-specialist language, so that readers from other fields can quickly make sense of it.</p>
<p>If you write in a way that is accessible to non-specialists, you are not only opening yourself up to citations by experts in other fields, but you are also making your writing available to laypeople, which is especially important in the biomedical fields. My Altmetric colleague Amy Rees notes that she sees a trend towards academics being more deliberate and thoughtful in how they disseminate their work. For example, we see more scientists writing lay summaries in publications such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://theconversation.com/us"><em>The Conversation</em></a>, a media outlet through which academics share news and opinions.</p>
